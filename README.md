# Climate-Impact-Analysis
Climate Change Impact Analysis project utilizing Python and SQL
Data Collection and Integration:
I have chosen to uese Open-Meteo's free and open-source API for real-time and historical weather data. This API provides detailed weather forecasts and historical data, which can be integrated into any analysis​ (Open Meteo)​​ (Registry of Open Data on AWS)​.
Setting up a PostgreSQL database to store and manage the collected data. Use SQLAlchemy and Flask for seamless integration between Python and your SQL database.
Data Processing and Storage:
Create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python to automate the data extraction from APIs, transformation (cleaning and preprocessing), and loading into the PostgreSQL database.
Ensuring the data is normalized and structured for efficient querying and analysis.
Statistical Modeling and Analysis:
Performing time series analysis using libraries like pandas and statsmodels to identify trends and anomalies in the climate data.
Using machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future climate scenarios. Libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow were and could be utilized for this purpose.
Assessing the impact of climate change on specific ecosystems or communities by correlating climate data with ecological and socio-economic data.
Data Visualization:
Plotly and Dash were and could be utilised to create interactive dashboards that visualize the climate data and model predictions. This can include maps, time series graphs, and other interactive elements.
Integrated geospatial data and create visualizations using libraries like GeoPandas and Folium to show the geographic impact of climate change.
Reporting and Communication:
Generating automated reports using Jupyter Notebooks and nbconvert, summarizing key findings and insights.
Developing a web application using Flask or Django to make the data and visualizations accessible to stakeholders and the public.
